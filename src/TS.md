# What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.

This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.





### What are the main advantages of TypeScript?

Going into greater technical detail, TypeScript gives you:

1. Strict typing
   Everything stays the way we define it. Need a variable to always be a number? It’ll always be a number, then.

2. Structural typing
   Indispensable when you care about fully defining the actual structure you use. JavaScript allows for a lot of strange things to be done, so relying on a specific structure is a much safer solution.

3. Type annotations
   A handy way of saying explicitly what type should be used.

4. Type inference
   Implicit typing performed by TypeScript itself, so that your developers don’t need to provide types where the compiler can find them on its own.


   


## Why do we use TypeScript in Angular?

When you think about the TypeScript Angular correlation, the obvious answer lies in Angular’s development with TypeScript. In essence, the two technologies work synergistically. However, it’s worth naming some major benefits that set TypeScript apart from other options.

●  Tooling capabilities — TypeScript has advanced tools that allow software engineers to make internal improvements to specific issues (refactoring) throughout the development life cycle. This can be done at scale without corrupting the base code. Other advanced tools include optional static typing, which enables developers to get hints from the environment (e.g., Webstorm, Visual Studio, etc.) indicating, for example, what arguments in a given method they should use and what a given method must return. These suggestions and support also help to avoid operations that shouldn’t be happening and might mess up the app functionality. It’s possible to use Angular without TypeScript, but unlike alternative JavaScript compilers, TypeScript includes rich dev tools that make it more than just another compiler.

●  No big rewrites needed with TypeScript for Angular — Remember that TypeScript is basically just JavaScript with types. This makes migration as easy as renaming a .js file extension to .ts. You can do it in stages, which means no big migrations.

●  Increased productivity — Using TypeScript in Angular applications provides access to editors like VS Code and WebStorm. This allows teams to effortlessly find new types and apply their features. This is a valuable productivity benefit for web application development.

●  Provides a better framework structure — Angular is a framework and TypeScript provides the structure for that framework. Modules, classes, and decorators allow users to organize, differentiate, and define, respectively. Furthermore, Angular has a QuickStart program which acts as a starting point for creating Angular applications, thus expediting development.
